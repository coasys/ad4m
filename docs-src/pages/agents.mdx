# Agents: The Foundation of AD4M

## Agent-Centric Architecture

In AD4M, we take a fundamentally different approach to building distributed systems. Instead of treating data as the primary building block, we place agents – humans and their computers – at the center of our architecture. This philosophical shift from "data-centric" to "agent-centric" has profound implications for how we build and interact with digital systems.

### Why Agent-Centric?

In traditional web architectures, data is treated as an objective, standalone entity that exists independently of its creators and consumers. This leads to centralized data silos, privacy concerns, and a disconnect between users and their digital footprint.

AD4M's agent-centric approach recognizes that:
- All data is fundamentally a claim or statement made by an agent
- Trust and context come from understanding who made a claim
- Agents should have sovereignty over their data and digital identity
- Interactions should be peer-to-peer between agents

## Technical Implementation

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

Every agent in AD4M is identified by a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier). DIDs are globally unique identifiers that:
- Are fully controlled by the agent
- Can be resolved to cryptographic keys
- Enable verifiable, decentralized digital identity

```js
// Generate a new agent with associated DID
await ad4m.agent.generate("YourSecurePassword");

// Get your agent's DID and information
const { did, perspective } = await ad4m.agent.me();
```

### Agent Expressions

AD4M comes with a built-in "agent bootstrap language" that resolves DIDs to `AgentExpression` objects. An `AgentExpression` contains:

```typescript
class Agent {
  // The agent's DID - their unique identifier
  did: string;

  // The agent's public semantic profile
  perspective?: Perspective;

  // Address of the language used for direct messaging
  directMessageLanguage?: string;
}
```

The `perspective` field is particularly important as it serves as the agent's "homepage" in the semantic web – a public space where they can share information about themselves using semantic links.

### Cryptographic Keys and Signatures

AD4M manages cryptographic keys associated with an agent's DID. These keys are used to:
- Sign expressions created by the agent
- Verify the authenticity of expressions from other agents
- Establish secure communication channels

When an agent creates an expression, AD4M automatically signs it with their private key:

```js
// The expression will be signed with the agent's key
const expression = await ad4m.expression.create(languageAddress, content);
```

### Communication Between Agents

Agents can communicate directly with each other through AD4M's messaging system. The runtime client provides convenient functions that handle the underlying direct message language mechanics:

```js
// Send a message to another agent
await ad4m.runtime.sendMessage(recipientDID, "Hello!");

// Listen for incoming messages
ad4m.runtime.addMessageCallback((message) => {
  console.log("Message from:", message.from);
  console.log("Content:", message.content);
});
```

Under the hood, AD4M uses the recipient's preferred direct message language (specified in their `AgentExpression`) to deliver the message. This abstraction ensures that:
- Messages are delivered using the recipient's chosen communication method
- The underlying transport mechanism can be changed without affecting applications
- Messages are properly encrypted and signed

You can also check if an agent is available for messaging:

```js
// Get another agent's information
const otherAgent = await ad4m.agent.byDID(someDID);

// Check if they have messaging capability
if (otherAgent.directMessageLanguage) {
  // They can receive messages
}
```

## Agent Perspectives

Every agent has a public perspective that acts as their semantic profile. This perspective can contain:
- Personal information
- Social connections
- Published content
- Public keys
- Contact methods

The perspective uses semantic links to create a rich web of information:

```js
// Add information to your public perspective
const { did } = await ad4m.agent.me();
await ad4m.agent.updatePublicPerspective({
  links: [
    { source: did, predicate: "foaf://name", target: "literal://string:Alice" },
    { source: did, predicate: "foaf://knows", target: "did:key:other-agent" }
  ]
});
```

## Security and Privacy

The agent-centric model provides several security benefits:
- All expressions are cryptographically signed
- Agents have full control over their keys and identity
- Communication can be encrypted end-to-end
- Trust is built on verifiable claims and signatures
