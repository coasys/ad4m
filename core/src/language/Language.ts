/** Interface of AD4M Languages
 * 
 * Any JavaScript module that implements a create() function that returns an object that implements this interface
 * is a valid AD4M language.
 * So the AD4M-internal representation of a language is an object that implements this interface.
 * 
 * Since there are a few different kinds of languages, this interface is split into optional sub-interfaces.
 * The only required property is the name of the language.
 * 
 * The most usual kind of language is the "Expression Language", which is a language that can be used to create
 * and share Expressions.
 * For that, implement the expressionsAdapter and expressionUI interface.
 * 
 * The second most common kind of language is the "Link Language", which is a language that builds the core
 * of AD4M Neighbourhoods.
 * For that, implement the linksAdapter interface.
