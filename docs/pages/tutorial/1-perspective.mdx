  This will get you to a shared Neighbourhood on Holochain in less than 20
  minutes! The code assumes an `ad4m` variable was setup as described in
  [Getting Started](/getting-started).
</Callout>

## Create a Perspective and add content

Adding a new perspective is as easy as

```js
const myPerspective = await ad4m.perspective.add("My new perspective");
```

The returned object is of type [PerspectiveProxy](api.md#class-perspectiveproxy),
which hides all the remote calls to the AD4M executor and can be treated like a
local database object.

Perspectives are basically local graph databases.
We can query all links on that proxy object with `get`:

```js
const allLinks = await myPerspective.get(new LinkQuery({})); // => []
```

In this case it should return an empty array since we just created that perspective.

So let's add something!
With the following code I'm creating an adhoc semantic statement
representing what I think about AD4M...

```js
import { Literal } from "@coasys/ad4m";

const me = await ad4m.agent.me();
const source = me.did;
const predicate = Literal.from("thinks").toUrl();
const target = Literal.from("AD4M will be the last social network").toUrl();

const linkExpresion = await myPerspective.add({ source, predicate, target });
```

Links consist of 3 URIs pointing to Expressions of Languages.
For this example, we made life easy by using the agent's DID and AD4M's `Literal` Language.

### Agent DID

For the source of our link, we got the user's DID URI by first getting
the users [Agent](api.md#class-agent) object with `ad4m.agent.me()`.
That has a DID property and DID URIs are considered valid URIs in AD4M
(they can be looked-up using the Agent bootstrap language which resolves
to the same Agent object we got through `ad4m.agent.me()` - just even if
that agent behind the resolved DID isn't me).

### Literal

The `Literal` Language is an AD4M Language without back-end.
It stores JavaScript literals (i.e. strings, numbers and objects)
by encoding them into the Expression URL.
So,

```js
Literal.from("thinks").toUrl();
```

returns `literal://string:thinks` - which is a valid URI -
and

```js
Literal.from("AD4M will be the last social network").toUrl();
```

returns `literal://string:AD4M%20will%20be%20the%20last%20social%20network`.
This is basically like URL parameters and let's us get around introducing Languages
before using Perspectives and Links.

We can decode the URL into a JavaScript literal like so:

```js
const string = Literal.fromUrl("literal://string:thinks").get();
// string == 'thinks'
```

### LinkExpression

We have put in a [Link](api.md#class-link) object into `myPerspective.add()`
(`{source, predicate, target}`),
but what this function returns is a [LinkExpression](api.md#class-linkexpression).

Even though this Perspective is not shared (yet) but just our private, local
graph database, we might want to share it [later](#2-publish-perspective-as-neighbourhood)
as Neighbourhood.
Then, all links added by some agent to their local Perspective will be shared
with the other agents using a LinkLanguage - a Language which defines Expressions
representing Links. That is LinkExpressions.

Using the [generic Expression template](api.html#expressiongeneric),
LinkExpressions wrap Links with author, timestamp and signature:

```js
{
    author: "did:key:zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
    timestamp: "Sun Oct 23 2022 15:31:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)",
    data: {
        source: "did:key:zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
        predicate: "literal://string:thinks",
        target: "literal://string:AD4M%20will%20be%20the%20last%20social%20network",
    },
    proof: {
        key: "#zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
        signature: "xxxx",
    }
}
```
