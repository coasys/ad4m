# Languages

Languages are essentially Node.js modules that encapsulate how to retrieve
and create content. You can think of them as **small edge functions** that are executed on the Agents device and that can communicate with different backends and technologies.

## Creating a Language

There are several types of Languages, but let's start with the most common one – an Expression Language.
Let's create a super simple `Readonly` Language that gives you the Open Graph data for a given website.

```js filename="adapter.js"
import type {
  Address,
  Expression,
  ExpressionAdapter,
  ReadonlyLanguage,
  LanguageContext,
} from "@coasys/ad4m";
import PutAdapter from "./putAdapter.js";
import openGraph from "open-graph-scraper";

class PutAdapter implements ReadonlyLanguage {
  getAddress(url: string) {
    return url;
  }
}

class Adapter implements ExpressionAdapter {
  putAdapter: ReadonlyLanguage;

  constructor() {
    this.putAdapter = new PutAdapter();
  }

  async get(address: Address): Promise<Expression> {
    const url = address.toString();
    const data = await openGraph({ url });
    return data;
  }
}
```

```js
import type { LanguageContext, Language} from '@coasys/ad4m'


export default function create(context: LanguageContext): Language {
    return {
        name: 'open-graph',
        expressionAdapter: new Adapter(context),
        isImmutableExpression: true
    } as Language
}
```
