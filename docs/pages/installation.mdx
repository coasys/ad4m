# Installation
To kick off with AD4M and tap into its agent-centric network, you’ll need to install the core runtime and, for JavaScript UI projects, 
the client libraries to connect your apps. AD4M provides the AD4M Launcher for ease of use, the AD4M CLI for developer flexibility, 
and two npm packages—`@coasys/ad4m` and `@coasys/ad4m-connect`—for front-end integration. 
This guide aligns with the v0.10.1 release candidate (as of March 24, 2025), featuring AI integration and enhanced Social DNA querying.

## AD4M Launcher
The AD4M Launcher is a Tauri-based, system-tray app that bundles the AD4M executor, a background UI and a setup wizard—ideal for users and developers seeking a quick start. 
It runs your agent’s instance locally, managing keys and data as the back-end for AD4M apps. Install it like this:
- Download: Visit the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/coasys/ad4m/releases) and download the binary for your OS—e.g., 
  `ADAM_Launcher_<version>-release-candidate-1_aarch64.dmg`, or `ADAM.Launcher_<version>-release-candidate-1_amd64-CUDA.AppImage` 
  (**We are working on a Windows build!.**)
- Run/Install: Execute the file. Windows may prompt a security warning (allow it; signed builds are coming); macOS/Linux follow standard app install steps.
- Initialize: Launch it to generate or unlock an agent (DID and keys). It runs on localhost:12000, offering WebSocket and GraphQL endpoints.

The Launcher delivers a plug-and-play AD4M experience, ready for UI connections.

## AD4M CLI (For Developers)
The AD4M CLI, written in Rust, gives developers command-line control over the AD4M ecosystem. 
Available on Crates.io (**currently not updated due to unpublished dependencies** ) and sourced at https://github.com/coasys/ad4m/tree/dev/cli, 
it includes two binaries: ad4m (CLI client) and ad4m-executor (full runtime without UI). It’s perfect for debugging, scripting, or Language development. 

### Set it up:
Follow the CLI [README](https://github.com/coasys/ad4m/tree/dev/cli) to install all necessary dependencies.
Clone or Install: Clone the repo and build:
```bash
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/coasys/ad4m.git
cd ad4m/cli
cargo install --path .
```
(Or install from Crates.io once we have published all dependencies: `cargo install ad4m`.)

Run the Executor: Start the full runtime with:
```bash
ad4m-executor run
```
Use ad4m init first to generate an agent if needed. It runs on localhost:12000.

CLI Usage Example: With the executor running, use the ad4m CLI to interact:
```bash
ad4m languages meta QmXyz123
```
This fetches metadata for a Language (e.g., social-context) at QmXyz123, outputting details like name and description. See the CLI README for commands like ad4m expression create.

The ad4m-executor provides the runtime (like the Launcher sans UI), while ad4m offers client commands—together, they’re a developer’s toolkit for AD4M.

## AD4M Client Libraries for JS UI Projects
For JavaScript UI projects (React, Vue, etc.), the client libraries `@coasys/ad4m` and `@coasys/ad4m-connect` connect your front-end to an AD4M instance (Launcher or CLI executor).
`@coasys/ad4m`: The core client, offering direct API access. Install it:
```bash
npm install @coasys/ad4m
```
Use it for raw interactions:
```javascript
import { Ad4mClient } from "@coasys/ad4m";
const client = new Ad4mClient("ws://localhost:12000");
const agent = await client.agent.me();
console.log(agent.did); // e.g., "did:key:z6Mk..."
```
It’s suited for custom logic needing full API control.

@coasys/ad4m-connect: A higher-level library with WebSocket connectivity and authentication handling, ideal for streamlined UI integration. Install it:
```bash
npm install @coasys/ad4m-connect
```
Use it to connect and authenticate:
```javascript

import Ad4mConnect from "@coasys/ad4m-connect";
 
const ui = Ad4mConnect({
  appName: "My First ADAM App",
  appDesc: "This is my first app here.",
  appDomain: "ad4m.dev",
  appIconPath: "https://i.ibb.co/GnqjPJP/icon.png",
  capabilities: [{ with: { domain: "*", pointers: ["*"] }, can: ["*"] }],
});
 
// .connect() will show the authentication pop up
ui.connect().then((client) => {
  // Save the client after authentication is done
  const perspectives = await client.perspective.all();
  console.log(perspectives[0].name); // e.g., "MyCommunity"
});

```
Authentication Handling: Per [auth docs](/auth), `@coasys/ad4m-connect` manages capability-based auth. On first connect, it requests a capability token from the executor, prompting the user (via Launcher UI or CLI) to approve. Specify required capabilities (e.g., perspective:write) in the config. Once approved, it stores a JWT locally, auto-authenticating future connections. If the executor isn’t running or capabilities mismatch, it retries or prompts again—simplifying secure app setup.

Start with `@coasys/ad4m-connect` for quick UI integration with auth, then use `@coasys/ad4m` for deeper API calls. Ensure the executor (Launcher or ad4m-executor) is active first.
## System Requirements
- OS: macOS 10.15+, or modern Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04+, glibc 2.35+). 
  **We are working on a Windows build!.**
- Memory: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended).
- Node.js: 18+
- Dependencies: Launcher bundles all (Holochain, Deno, Rust); CLI needs Rust; client libs need Node.js (18+) and an executor instance.
- Optional: CUDA for GPU acceleration AI inference.
With these tools installed, you’re ready to harness AD4M’s distributed power.
